### Making random characters in a game ### 

## The goal:##

The Relationship game (name still pending) is a multiplayer interactive relationship game that makes you more intentional in dealing with conflicts and navigating relationship. 
the characters involed in the game requires generation of muliple random characters (with different characteristics). 

Thus, by writing code, I can generate large number of random characters for the "dating" pool of the card games ...



Package used: 
import os
from PIL import Image 
import panda as pd 
import matplotlib 
import random 




#current process working on 

- make a list/group within the directory (through panda usage) 
- Adds additional accessories (increase randomization) 
- improve hand movements/locations
